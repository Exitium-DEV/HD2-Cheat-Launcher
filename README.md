# HELLDIVERS 2 (emoisback DLL) Launcher
Custom launch binary for Helldivers 2, with the objective of reducing detection rate of 'version.dll' hacks

## Usage
**DELETE ANY EXISTING 'version.dll' FROM YOUR GAME FILES**

Download latest "version.dll" from [here](https://github.com/emoisback/Helldivers-2-Internal-Hack-Dll-Proxy-PoC/actions)

**I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU COMPILE YOUR OWN DLL, AND MODIFY THE STRINGS**

Download latest "Helldivers 2" executable from the 'releases' tab ----->

Place both files in the same folder, use EXE to start the game!

IMPORTANT: DO NOT PLACE THESE IN YOUR HELLDIVERS 'bin'


Continue to use the EXE to start the game as it will continue to re-hash the original .dll (this is to avoid the anti-cheat)

When the "version.dll" gets an update, just swap out the DLL (which is in the same folder as the EXE), to the new one, and run the EXE, simple! :)

Happy cheating!
